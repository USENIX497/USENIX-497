We provide part of the codes in this paper. The codes consist of three parts: 1) extract graph feature from the APK file. 2) Generate the adversarial example through BagAmmo algorithm. 3)According to the perturbation  manipulate the samli codes and rebuild to APK file. We open the codes of part 1 and part 3, and the other codes will be available soon.
